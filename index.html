            <p>Essay on My Favourite Game Badminton: Badminton is a game that we can play indoors and outdoors. Traditionally people play it indoors. It is a game of speed and accuracy, and I love the sport. I love playing badminton with my friends. I love the feeling of getting better and better at the game.Badminton is my all-time favorite game right from childhood. I just simply love to play badminton at any part of the day. My dad taught me the game with a small plastic racket when I was just two and started loving the game from then on. Although I am not a professional player, I do play the game regularly. Badminton or shuttlecock is a sport for all and is a favorite among many children and adults.
It is being played by everyone and everywhere, right from inside the houses to the huge badminton courts or stadiums. It is a great game that improves hand-eye coordination, focus and attention, physical and mental strength, decision-making skills, and overall makes us physically and mentally fit. It is played with a racket and a shuttlecock by two or four players across the net. It requires good physical stamina and mental agility to play this game. This game also enhances competitive and social skills.</p>
